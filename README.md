Import files from iDOLM@STER SP fan translation to CSV files for The iDOLM@STER (XBOX360).

Usage:
SPImporter (SP script files folfer) (IMAS1 CSV files folder)

The tool will match and copy translated text from SP files to CSV-files. It will owerwrite whatever data was in the CSV-files in case of match, so it's better to use it on "raw" files before doing any work on them.
